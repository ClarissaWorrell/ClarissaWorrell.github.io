Demonstration of the updated app

### Enhancements 

- Redesigned the menu and current order displays

- Converted photos to byte array from bitmap to insert them into the SQL database, converted back to bitmap when retrived

- Add quanitiy options to the menu for each item using plus and minus buttons so that the user can't enter invaild input

- Checks for existance of an item in the current order database before adding a new item, updates the quanitity by adding the users current quantity to the previous quanity if the item exists????

- Stored the calculated subtotal of each item in a list

- Used a for loop to iterate through the list of subtotal and calculate the total price of the order

- Create a changing text view 

- Update the recycler view for the current order in realtime when an item is deleted

- Stored the data from the current order in lists and added those lists to a hashmap to be inserted in the Firebase database
