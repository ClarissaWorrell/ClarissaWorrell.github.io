## Clarissa Worrell Portfolio

My name is Clarissa Worrell. I am a student passionate about technology and making a difference in the world. I am completing my Bachelorâ€™s in computer science with a concentration in software engineering at Southern New Hampshire University. This portfolio is a collection of artifacts created for my capstone class. It shows my passion and skills for computer science, specifically mobile app development. The project below shows the improvements made to my Android app, focusing on software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. 

### Professional Self-Assessment

When starting the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I was unsure of what I wanted to do for a career. After taking a few introductory coding classes online in high school, I knew that I wanted to work with programming, but I did not know what specialty. Computer science is a vast field and has many options because technology is used in everything now. The wide range of classes required for the computer science degree exposed me to many different fields related to computer science. About halfway through completing my degree, I realized that mobile app development is the field that interests me the most. I enjoy being able to see the final product that the user will interact with. Mobile apps have a significant impact on consumers' lives, and I would like to create something that will positively impact people. I have created apps on Android and iOS and enjoyed the process of both. 
 
My time in the computer science program has taught me many soft and technical skills. It has provided me with a solid base of knowledge to start my career with. I understand the major development subjects such as object-oriented programing, coding best practices, data structures, algorithms, databases, and security. This portfolio demonstrates some of my skills in all of these subjects.

The courses taken for the computer science degree allowed me to work in a collaborative environment with other students while learning about all aspects of software engineering. I not only practiced collaborating in a team environment in many of my courses, but I learned each individual's role in the software development life cycle. I understand the tools and skills necessary to create a program starting from concept to completion using agile software development. This includes communicating with the customer about wants and expectations, creating a proof of concept, mapping a realist timeline for the project, developing the program, and testing before deployment. I believe that learning and improving my knowledge should never stop, and I now have the perfect base to start my career and continue that process. 

The artifact selected to improve upon for the three categories in the portfolio is an Android app developed in Java. The app is for a fake local coffee shop. It includes an ordering system along with general information about the business, such as the location, hours, about us page, and social media links. This app was created in a previous course at Southern New Hampshire University. I chose this artifact to enhance because it can demonstrate my technical skills in all three categories of the capstone course. This artifact allows me to create a fully functional program that interacts with users and demonstrates my interests and skills. The goals for this project were to improve the design and user experience of the app, create efficient data structures and algorithms to solve problems in the app, increase the security of the data stored in the app, and use databases to store large amounts of data. All of these goals were achieved and documented below. Developing these enhancements provided me with an excellent opportunity to demonstrate what I know, advance my existing skills, and learn new techniques. 

### Code Review

This is a thorough code review completed before making enhancements to the app. It showcases how the app originally worked, discusses problems with the program, and planned improvements.

### Software Engineering and design Artifact

Skills learned 

- Designing UX and UI for an android app 

- Implemented SurveyMonkey SDK for an in-app rating system

- Implemented Facebook and Google APIs for third party login

The first artifact heavily focuses on the user experience of the app. It shows my skills in creating a functional, intuitive, and inclusive app design. Many of the displays in the app were redesigned to make it more cohesive and visually appealing. Multiple APIs were implemented to get data that would not be available without it and add functionality that I could not have created. The addition of third-party login systems creates a secure way to log in and verify a user.

### Algorithms and Data Structures Artifact

Skills learned 

- Converting images to and from byte arrays into Bitmap to insert them into the SQLite database and then convert back to display to the user 

- Updating user displays, specifically recycler views, in real-time

- Adding data from SQLite recycler view into lists

- Creating a hashmap with lists

The second artifact creates the necessary data structures to store data from databases and insert data into the databases. It also updates the menu and order displays to be more functional and easier to read. A quantity button was added with constraints so that the user cannot enter invalid input. This decreases security risks. A class was created to map the data from the current order into a hash map for database insertion and create the methods needed to get the same data when an order was retrieved from Firebase.

### Databases Artifact

Skills learned 

- Implementing the FirebaseAPI for authentication and NoSQL real-time database 

- Creating, writing, and reading from a NoSQL Firebase database

- Retrieving JSON data and formatting it into nested recycler views

- Adding Photos to SQL database using BLOB

The last artifact adds complexity to the SQLite Menu database and implements the Firebase authentication and database APIs. Adding photos of items to the menu allows for easily linking the correct photo to each item and frees up storage space on the device. Using the Firebase NoSQL database to store user information works with the Firebase authentication to only allow verified users to access the database. The current orders are added under the correct user in firebase and then accessed later to display them in a nested recycler view.
