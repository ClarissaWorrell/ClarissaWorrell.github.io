## Clarissa Worrell Portfolio

My name is Clarissa Worrell, I am a student passionate about technology and making a difference in the world. I am completing my Bachelorâ€™s in computer science with a concentration in software engineering at Southern New Hampshire University. This ePortfolio is a collection of artifacts created for my capstone class. It shows my passion and skills for computer science, specifically mobile app development. The project below shows the improvements made to my Android app, focusing on software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. 

### Profession Self-assessment

// Professional review

### Code Review

This is a thorough code review completed before making enhancements to the app. It showcases how the app originally worked, discusses problems with the program, and improvements to be made.

### Software Engineering and design Artifact

Skills learned 

- Designing UX and UI for an android app 

- Implemented SurveyMonkey SDK for an in-app rating system

- Implemented Facebook and Google APIs for third party login

The first artifact heavily focuses on the user experience of the app. It shows my skills in creating a functional, intuitive, and inclusive app design. Many of the displays in the app were redesigned to make it more cohesive and visually appealing. Multiple APIs were implemented to get data that would not be available without it and add functionality that I could not have created. Third-party login systems were added to create a secure way to login and verify a user.

### Algorithms and Data Structures Artifact

Skills learned 

- Converting images to and from byte arrays into Bitmap to insert them into the SQLite database and then convert back to display to user 

- Updating user displays, specifically recycler views, in real-time

- Adding data from SQLite recyclerview into lists

- Creating a hashmap with lists

### Databases Artifact

Skills learned 

- Implementing the FirebaseAPI for authentication and NoSQL real-time database 

- Creating, writing, and reading from NoSQL Firebase database

- Retrieving JSON data and formatting it into nested recycler views

- Adding Photos to SQL database using BLOB

The last artifact adds complexity to the SQLite Menu database and implements the Firebase authentication and database APIs. Adding photos of items to the menu allows for easily linking the correct photo to each item and frees up storage space on the device. Using the Firebase NoSQL database to store user accounts and past orders works with the Firebase authentication to only allow verified users to access the database. The current order are added under the correct user in firebase and then accessed later to display them in a nested recycler view.
