# Artifact One - Software Engineering and Design 

The artifact for the software engineering and design category is an android app created for a fake local coffee shop. It is a way for the business to make sales, market themselves, and connect with their customers. I chose this artifact to showcase my skills in software engineering and design because app development involves lots of thought about the design to create a product that is not only functional but intuitive and enjoyable from a user's perspective. The whole app showcases my skills in creating a program that works together to achieve a goal. The login system demonstrates that I can work with API and consider the best option for features in the app, considering user experience, resources, and security. 

### Showcased Skills

- UX and UI designs

- Implementing APIs and SDKs

- Works appropriately with the accessibility options of the device, such as color contrast and increasing text size

- Implementing best practices

### Demonstration of the updated app

### Enhancements 

- Created login and settings screens

- Changed the opening page of the app to the login screen which allows the user to login which automatically creates an account in the database or continue as a guest

- Changed the login feature to the third-party systems Facebook and Google

- Updated the UI design of the home screen, contact and find us screen, and our story screen

- Added a navigation drawer

- Improved the design and flow of the app using Sketch (a digital design tool)

- Added an in-app rating survey using Survey Monkey to get feedback from the user

- Commented the existing code 

- Fixed existing issues, such as hardcoded strings in the activity XML files, missing constraints on views in XML files, and removing unnecessary code

### Reflection

The enhancements for the software engineering and design category continued through the creation of all the artifacts because I am still learning about how to design the user interface for mobile apps. When researching how to make an inclusive app, I learned about the different types of accessibility features available. Each Android device has accessibility options in the settings of the device, such as larger text and color contrast. These settings allowed me to create an app that is compatible with those settings rather than creating them in my app. I also learned about external software that can help create the UI and standard features in android apps, such as a navigation drawer. These enhancements allowed me to learned more about XML in android programming. I learned that strings in the XML files should not be hardcoded and how to create new views such as image buttons. I learned how to implement the Google login API and the Survey Monkey API. 

I struggled to implement the Survey Monkey API because the documentation for Android implementation is limited. The documentation only shows one way to implement it, so I had to do testing to get it to work properly. I found it challenging to design a cohesive and visually pleasing app because app design can be very interpretive, so I will always be learning. Trends constantly change, and understanding how to use XML to achieve those looks in the most efficient way possible is something that I have been learning about. I made many improvements to this area of the app, but I think the user interfaces could still be improved more to make the app look more professional and engaging.
